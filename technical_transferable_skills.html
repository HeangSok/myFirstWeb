        <h2>Content</h2>
        <p class="container letter__spacing justify__content">
          While working as an intern student at Securestack company as part of
          my work placement, I encountered professional challenges with both
          technical and transferable skills. In terms of technical skills, I had
          to convert Bash script penetration testing logic to Python. First, I
          thought it was easy to accomplish since I already knew and made some
          projects in Python, and all I needed to do was to translate syntaxes
          from Bash to Python. Yet I was totally wrong because my project
          focused more on logic and how to run Bash penetration testing tools
          within Python. Though my prior knowledge in Python had helped me a lot
          with this project, I started to struggle with my tasks from week 4 of
          this placement. Time management skill was also one of my concerned. I
          could not balance between my schoolwork and the placement. This made
          me fail behind the assignment deadline. In addition, I lacked
          problem-solving skills. I noticed that at the beginning of the
          placement whenever I got stuck with my codes, I would delegate some
          time to find the solution; if I could not find it, I would go directly
          to ask my supervisor for help. It was not a good practice to always
          get the answers from the supervisor. I knew I needed to be changed,
          and I had to do something about it, or I would not make it for this
          trimester.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <br />
        <h2>Action</h2>
        <p class="container letter__spacing justify__content">
          For the sake of personal development, I had developed good time
          management skills, especially for combining studying with the work
          placement demands. First, I would start doing the task that was
          important and urgent first so that I would not rush to submit my
          assignment or project; then I would do the important work that was not
          so urgent. With this strategy, I eliminated unimportant tasks and
          focused on the big picture. Since then, I had more time to learn new
          skills related to my project, such as Git, Docker Engine, FastAPI, and
          PostgreSQL. Having discussed my issue with my supervisor at
          Securestack, I was able to develop strategies on how to solve my
          coding problems with penetration testing tools as well. Though I still
          went to him for some advice during the placement, the numbers had cut
          down a lot.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <br />
        <h2>Result</h2>
        <p class="container letter__spacing justify__content">
          With the support and mentor of my supervisor, I was able to change and
          improve my skill set as progressed. There was an increase in learning
          since week 7 of this placement as I had completed 70 percent of my
          project in that milestone and made each tool run successfully and
          simultaneously in Docker containers using Docker-Compose and
          Dockerfile. At the end of the placement, I completed 100 percent of my
          project by the deadline, and successfully integrated it with the
          front-end parts of other intern students and pushed it to GitHub
          repository. I think if I had allowed time for myself to develop
          strategies to fix the weakness of my transferable skills at the
          beginning of this placement, I would not be so stress about my
          assignment and project submissions and could have done them with a
          better result. On reflection, I could feel that I became industry
          ready and more confident in my coding techniques and transferable
          skills due to these 12 weeks of acquired knowledge and experience with
          Securestack Company.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <br />
        <h2>Learning</h2>
        <p class="container letter__spacing justify__content">
          I learnt that transferable skills are very crucial for my personal and
          professional development. As mentioned above, most of my problems had
          been solved when I developed strategies and improved my transferable
          skills. I will therefore continue to acquire more knowledge to prepare
          myself to face professional challenges, especially in the area of
          decision making, critical thinking, time management, and
          problem-solving. I want to see learning as part of me because learning
          new skills every day is a lifelong experience; and I will not only
          improve the quality of my coding techniques but also enhance my
          personal development to close the gap between theory and practice.

        <h2>Additional Artefact For 7822ICT (Lifelong Learning)</h2>
        <br />
        <p class="container letter__spacing justify__content">
          When I was an undergraduate student majoring in accounting, I had to follow protocols, standards, and regulations; thus, I learnt by heart, and like other Asian students, the way I developed my skills over time was to remember the learning materials line by line because it was the only key to my university success as my exams and assignments contained only closed questions. As a result, I did not pay attention to the so-called critical thinking or design thinking. Put it in other words, I was a passive learner. I rather accepted accounting techniques that mention in the books than thought out of the box. After I graduated, I knew I was a good accountant, but I was never a professional one. 
        </p>
        <br />

        <p class="container letter__spacing justify__content">
          At the time I decided to change my career path to computer science, I felt something was not right with my learning approach and the way I was taught. Coming to this realization, I began searching for programs to initiate my new career path and earn my master’s degree here in Australia. As I sit down to reflect on my time in the computer science major, I am confident that I made the right decision to come to Australia. As a lifelong learner, I found it interesting how my learning philosophy has continued to evolve over here. I have over 580 courses on Udemy platform ranking from accountant and technology to public speaking and critical thinking. I think the number of the courses on the platform will continue to improve as there are fantastic skills out there that I have not yet learnt. Now, not only I focus on the technical skill sets in my field of study, but I also target more on transferable skills that could add more value to my work performances as well as learning outcomes. These transferable skills include critical thinking, decision making, time management, and problem-solving. 
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="container letter__spacing justify__content">
          I believe that transferable skills are universally essential in the workplace because they contribute to the success of a team or organization. Taking problem-solving and critical thinking as an example, they are important in almost any job, and HR looks for them during the interview. What I am trying to say is I do not have to remember everything in the field of computer science to become a tech-savvy because the technology evolving so fast every day. What I learn today might be deprecated tomorrow, and who knows? For instance, UIkit framework is being replaced by SwiftUI to develop iOS. Thus, all I need is to think critically to help myself better understand the problems and to avoid any kind of negative belief and focus more on my strengths to find the solutions to the problems. This is what the employer wants to see, and it is how I prove that I can do the job even if I am not the perfect math of the job description.
