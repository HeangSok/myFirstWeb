        <h2>Describe</h2>
        <p class="container letter__spacing justify__content">
          My work placement took place in Securestack company which is one of
          the top 20 cybersecurity startups to watch in 2021. The main purpose
          of this placement is to build a lightweight penetration testing web
          application that allows users to successfully scan a website and get
          its network security test results which include both the
          vulnerabilities and strengths of the website. The whole placement had
          to be completed by week 12 of trimester 1, 2022. To complete this
          medium size project in a short period of given time, 4 students were
          engaged in this project from the front-end to the back-end of web
          design. My role was to build penetration testing logics and tools for
          the back-end design using Python programming language. On my first
          meeting with Securestack company, the senior developer had clearly
          explained all the processes and objectives of this placement; tools
          and required software were installed on the same day. During the
          placement, we normally had a morning meeting to track and follow up
          with the project's progress. All team members were working hard and
          built good communication; thus, everything was completed as planned,
          and we were able to hand in our project on time.

        <h2>Interpret</h2>
        <p class="container letter__spacing justify__content">
          Personally, I feel that the whole procedures of this placement were
          brilliantly organised by Securestack company to help the intern
          students to break the gap between the theoretical knowledge that were
          taught in class and the real-life Software Development Life Cycle.
          Before this placement, I had limited knowledge in Python programming
          language and generic skills, such as Version Control and Docker
          Engine. However, with the support and mentor from Securestack's senior
          developer, I understood what an IT professional should really do at
          each phase of the project life cycle, and I also noticed my skill sets
          were improved quickly overtime. In addition, Securestack offered some
          tutorials about new technologies at each milestone of the project. The
          company also brought the team members together and encouraged us to
          share ideas and speak openly to figure out how we could develop
          solutions to problems. As an IT practitioner, I can tell that this is
          a priceless experience for me to gain in-depth knowledge in the
          computer science industry; and it will be very beneficial to my future
          career.

        <h2>Evaluate</h2>
        <p class="container letter__spacing justify__content">
          One of the most personally rewarding aspects of my placement
          experience was the opportunity to work as a team in a real company.
          Before, I used to think that teamwork is not an effective way to
          complete projects. It was not something that I had previously liked to
          practise in class because I had more control over my projects if I did
          them alone. However, this placement experience has changed my
          perception of teamwork and helped me to understand why it is so
          important to work as a team to achieve the goal. From working within
          Securestack company team, I think that good teamwork and communication
          in this IT industry underpins almost everything that an IT
          professional needs, and it can determine the quality of products that
          customers will receive. On top of that, I have improved my
          transferable skills, such as critical thinking, decision making, and
          problem-solving, through team discussions. This made me become
          passionate to work with my team members so that we could compensate
          for each other weaknesses and worked toward success.
        </p>

        <h2>Plan</h2>
        <p class="container letter__spacing justify__content">
          Reflecting on my 12 weeks of experience with Securestack company, I
          have gained an immense amount of knowledge in both technical and
          transferable skills. It has opened a path and guided my way to become
          an IT professional. To improve my knowledge in both areas as a
          lifelong learner, I usually spend one hour every morning (because
          human brains are fresh at that time) to study new generic skills or
          watch TED Talks to motivate my career aspirations. In addition, I plan
          on joining ACS Australia where I can continue to develop my skills and
          build networks with other senior developers which is very beneficial
          to my future professional life.
