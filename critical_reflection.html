        <h2>Describe</h2>
        <p class="container letter__spacing justify__content">
          My work placement took place in Securestack company which is one of
          the top 20 cybersecurity startups to watch in 2021. The main purpose
          of this placement is to build a lightweight penetration testing web
          application that allows users to successfully scan a website and get
          its network security test results which include both the
          vulnerabilities and strengths of the website. The whole placement had
          to be completed by week 12 of this trimester. To complete this medium
          size project in a short period of given time, 4 students were engaged
          in this project from the front-end to the back-end of web design. My
          role was to build penetration testing logics and tools for the
          back-end design using Python programming language. On my first meeting
          with Securestack company, the senior developer had clearly explained
          all the processes and objectives of this placement; tools and required
          software were installed on the same day. During the placement, we
          normally had a morning meeting to track and follow up with the
          project's progress. All team members were working hard and built good
          communication; thus, everything was completed as planned, and we were
          able to hand in our project on time.
        </p>

        <h2>Interpret</h2>
        <p class="container letter__spacing justify__content">
          Personally, I feel that the whole procedures of this placement were
          brilliantly organised by Securestack company to help the intern
          students to break the gap between the theoretical knowledge that were
          taught in class and the real-life Software Development Life Cycle.
          Before this placement, I had limited knowledge in Python programming
          language and generic skills, such as Version Control and Docker
          Engine. However, with the support and mentor from Securestack's senior
          developer, I understood what an IT professional should really do at
          each phase of the project life cycle, and I also noticed my skill sets
          were improved quickly overtime. In addition, Securestack offered some
          tutorials about new technologies at each milestone of the project. The
          company also brought the team members together and encouraged us to
          share ideas and speak openly to figure out how we could develop
          solutions to problems. As an IT practitioner, I can tell that this is
          a priceless experience for me to gain in-depth knowledge in the
          computer science industry; and it will be very beneficial to my future
          career.
        </p>

        <h2>Evaluate</h2>
        <p class="container letter__spacing justify__content">
          One of the most personally rewarding aspects of my placement
          experience was the opportunity to work as a team in a real company.
          Before, I used to think that teamwork is not an effective way to
          complete projects. It was not something that I had previously liked to
          practise in class because I had more control over my projects if I did
          them alone. However, this placement experience has changed my
          perception of teamwork and helped me to understand why it is so
          important to work as a team to achieve the goal. From working within a
          team, I think that good communication in this industry underpins
          almost everything that an IT professional does, and it can determine
          the quality of products that customers will receive. On top of that, I
          have improved my transferable skills, such as critical thinking,
          decision making, and problem-solving, through team discussions. This
          made me become passionate to work with my team members so that we
          could compensate for each other weaknesses and worked toward success.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <br />
        <h2>Plan</h2>
        <p class="container letter__spacing justify__content">
          Reflecting on my 12 weeks of experience with Securestack company, I
          have gained an immense amount of knowledge in both technical and
          transferable skills. It has opened a path and guided my way to become
          an IT professional soon. To improve my knowledge in both areas, I
          usually spend one hour every morning (because human brains are fresh
          at that time) to study new generic skills or watch TED Talks to
          motivate my career aspirations. In addition, I plan on joining ACS
          Australia where I can continue to develop my skills and build networks
          with other senior developers which is very beneficial to my future
          professional life.

            Like other junior developers, coding is my habit. I like to spend
            the whole day in my room just to code and improve new skills. I also
            love jogging around my neighborhood in the evening because I believe
            that exercising can boost productivity.

          <h3>Aspiration</h3>
          <p class="letter__spacing justify__content">
            Coding is not easy, and it's exhausting sometimes, but it feels
            amazing each time I could solve the problems. I think that a good
            coder doesn't have to remember everything, but one who enjoys what
            he is doing and has the commitment to complete his project.
