        <h2>Describe</h2>
        <p class="container letter__spacing justify__content">
          My work placement took place in Securestack company which is one of
          the top 20 cybersecurity startups to watch in 2021. The whole
          placement had to be completed by week 12 of this trimester. To
          complete this medium size project in a short period of given time, 4
          students were engaged in this project from the frontend to the backend
          of web design. My role was to build penetration testing logic and
          tools for the backend design using Python programming language. During
          the placement, I encountered professional challenges in transferable
          skills as I tried my best to complete each task I was assigned, but I
          somehow ended up doing the wrong things. The things that my supervisor
          did not expect me to do. For example, there was a time when my
          supervisor expected me to use an API to complete a task, but I wrote a
          code to complete that task from scratch instead. It was a waste of
          time. In addition, there was also a time that I changed my code
          variable names and did not inform my team members about it, and
          because of that, I crushed the whole system. I knew I needed to change
          my attitude, and I went to talk with my supervisor and ask him for
          some advice and feedback. He told me that he acknowledged my coding
          skills, but my communication skill was the problem in this industry,
          and he hoped I could improve it throughout the placement.

        <h2>Interpret</h2>
        <p class="container letter__spacing justify__content">
          Having discussed my issue with my supervisor at Securestack, I clearly
          understood that good communication skill was very important for my
          future career as an IT practitioner because if I could not get what my
          client wanted me to do, I would end up giving a wrong product to the
          client in the future, and this might lead to a project fail. Moreover,
          If I could not build a good communication with my team members, it was
          unlikely that I could finish the project smoothly. Since then, I tried
          my best to build good communication with them and to improve my range
          of words related to computer science so that I would not misunderstand
          what my supervisor wanted me to complete again. If only I tried to
          clarify each task that I was assigned from the beginning, I would not
          waste a lot of time and work in the wrong direction. On the other
          hand, I could have brought the team members together and encouraged
          each of us to share ideas and speak openly to figure out how we could
          develop solutions to our coding problems as well as discussing about
          any changes that we made in our code.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <br />
        <h2>Evaluate</h2>
        <p class="container letter__spacing justify__content">
          After I changed my attitude, I could see that my work performance
          improved significantly as a team that was what my supervisor wanted to
          see. Before, I used to think that teamwork was not an effective way to
          complete projects. It was not something that I had previously liked to
          practise in class because I had more control over my projects if I did
          them alone. However, this placement experience has changed my
          perception of teamwork and helped me to understand why it is so
          important to work as a team to achieve the goal. From working within a
          team, I think that good communication in this industry underpins
          almost everything that an IT professional does, and it can determine
          the quality of products that customers will receive as well.
          Personally, I feel that the experience that I gained and learnt from
          working with Securestack is priceless because I got the opportunity to
          work in one of the top cybersecurity companies which allowed me to
          understand what skills an IT professional should have when he/she
          enters the industry. I think the whole procedures of this placement
          were brilliantly organised by Securestack to help the intern students
          to break the gap between the theoretical knowledge that were taught in
          class and the real-life Software Development Life Cycle.

        <h2>Plan</h2>
        <p class="container letter__spacing justify__content">
          The advice that I have learnt from my supervisor is very important for
          me in many areas as it will open a path and guide my way to become a
          competent software developer. Soft skill like communication is what I
          must have in my profession as a developer because I am going to use it
          a lot with clients and other people as a team after I graduate. To
          improve what I have learned from Securestack in the future, I usually
          spend two hours every morning learing new skills which include
          technical and transferable skills. In addition, I plan on joining ACS
          Australia where I can continue to develop my skills and build networks
          with other senior developers which is also very beneficial to my
          future professional life.
